    "  * New wave of artifical intelligence does not bring us intelligence, but the critical compononent of intelligence called precition (recognizing faces, translating from one langauage to another)\n",
    "  * However, prediction is not always the solution. For example, in the hotel industry, prices are low outside the tourist season, and prices are high when demand is highest and hotels are full. Given that data, a naive prediction might suggest that increasing the price would lead to more rooms sold.\n",
